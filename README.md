# LionOnTheWeb.com

## About
This project documents the journey of the continuous improvement of the https://www.lionontheweb.com website, a personal website that is the home of the blog and portfolio for myself, Asad Richardson. The project is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) via Vite, Yarn, Contentful API and Netlify. 

This project will also serve to demonstrate my level as a senior engineer with up to date programming practices, accessibility, and performance. I also just want to demonstrate how intuitive building a fully functioning site with SEO, and mixed media can be with Svelte! 

## Development
- This project uses Vite as the engine and Yarn as the package manager for this project
	- If you wish to use either of these dependencies, please ensure that node `18.6.0` is installed first (I personally use nvm to manage my node versions per directory)
- Run the project by running `yarn run dev` locally to get started
- Other project commands are available in this project's `package.json` file
